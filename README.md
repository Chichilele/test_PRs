# test_PRs
Simple repo to test PRs on branches still under PRs. GitHub doesn't seem to update the PR Target when comparing.

## Solutions

1. Create the child PR after the parent PR has been merged into master (or whatever target branch)
2. Alternatively one "update" the target branch by doing an edit and save the child PR once the parent PR has been merged.
